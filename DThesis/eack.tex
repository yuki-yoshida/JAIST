First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my
supervisor, Professor Kokichi Futatsugi for his acute guidance,
encouragement, and unlimited support throughout the duration of my
research. Without his support, this thesis could not have been
completed.  In addition, I am indebted to him for giving me this
invaluable opportunity to study abroad and providing me the financial
support.

I would like to thank Professor Kazuhiro Ogata for his feedback and
wise advices on my research. The quality of this research was
significantly improved because of him.

My last acknowledgements go to my family for their support,
unconditional love and vital encouragement throughout my study and
throughout my life.
