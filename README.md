# Interactive Theorem Proving Framework for Declarative Cloud Orchestration

An interactive theorem proving framework for verifying liveness properties of declarative cloud orchestration is proposed.  The framework provides (1) a general way to formalize specifications of different kinds of cloud orchestration tools and (2) a procedure for how to verifying a kind of liveness properties of formalized specifications.  It also provides (a) general templates and libraries of formal descriptions for specifying orchestration of cloud systems and (b) logical proofs of lemmas for general predicates of the libraries.

The framework has been applied to the verification of specifications of AWS CloudFormation and also of OASIS TOSCA, and is demonstrated to be effective for reducing generic routine work and making a verification engineer concentrate on the work specific to each individual system.
